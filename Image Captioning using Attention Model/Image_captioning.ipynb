    "In this project, I will develop an Image Captioning model that leverages an Attention mechanism to generate descriptive captions for images. The model's architecture will consist of two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encoder: This component utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract high-level features from input images. The CNN will process the image and produce a set of feature maps that capture essential visual information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decoder: The Decoder, implemented as a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), will use the feature maps from the Encoder to generate descriptive captions. An Attention mechanism will be incorporated to enable the model to focus on different parts of the image while generating each word in the caption, thereby improving the quality and relevance of the generated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "By integrating these components, the model aims to provide accurate and contextually rich descriptions for a variety of images."
